# insertionSortRecursion
Insertion sort is another sorting algorithm that can be implemented recursively, although it's more naturally expressed iteratively. Nonetheless, implementing it recursively can be a good exercise in understanding recursive algorithms and sorting techniques. Hereâ€™s how you can implement Insertion Sort recursively in Java:
